## Using Hooks

### useState

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

```
const [name, setName] = useState<string | undefined>();
```

```
setTate(previousState => previousState + 1)
```

### useReducer

Here is an example of a useReducer call:

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

The dispatch function takes in an argument that describes the change. This object is called an action.

```
dispatch({ type: 'add', amount: 2 });
```

The types for useReducer can be explicitly defined in its generic parameter as follows:

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer<Reducer<State, Action>>( reducer, initialState );
```

```
type State = {
    name: string | undefined;
    score: number;
    loading: boolean;
};

type Action =
    | {
          type: "initialize";
          name: string;
      }
    | {
          type: "increment";
      }
    | {
          type: "decrement";
      }
    | {
          type: "reset";
      };


function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "initialize":
            return { name: action.name, score: 0, loading: false };
        case "increment":
            return { ...state, score: state.score + 1 };
        case "decrement":
            return { ...state, score: state.score - 1 };
        case "reset":
            return { ...state, score: 0 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

const [{ name, score, loading }, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
        name: undefined,
        score: 0,
        loading: true,
    });

useEffect(() => {
    getPerson().then(({ name }) => {
        dispatch({ type: "initialize", name });
    });
}, []);

```

### ref Hook

An initial value can optionally be passed into useRef. The type of the ref can be explicitly defined in a generic argument for useRef:

```
const ref = useRef<Ref>(initialValue);
```

The generic argument is useful when no initial value is passed or is null

A common use of the useRef Hook is to access HTML elements imperatively. HTML elements have a ref attribute in JSX that can be assigned to a ref.

```
function MyComponent() {
    const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
    function doSomething() {
        console.log(
            "All the properties and methods of the input",
            inputRef.current
        );
    }
    return <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />;
}
```

The ref used here is called inputRef and is initially null. So, it is explicitly given a type of HTMLInputElement, which is a standard type for input elements

```
const addButtonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
```

To recap, the useRef Hook creates a mutatable value and doesnâ€™t cause a re-render when changed. It is commonly used to access HTML elements in React imperatively.

### useMemo
